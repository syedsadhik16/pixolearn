-- Fix: Prevent users from changing their own role via profile UPDATE
-- Replace the UPDATE policy with one that enforces role immutability
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON public.profiles FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = id
    AND role = (SELECT role FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
